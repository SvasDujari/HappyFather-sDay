  <div class="text_body" style="border: 5px solid black; margin: 130px;">
    <p>Thank you so much for all your wisdom that you have bestowed upon me over the years.<br/>
       I am forever grateful and have learned so much from you that has been<br/>
       genuinely used and applied in my everyday life.</p>
    <p>At many points I have asked myself what I would need to do to become a good<br/>
       parent in the future.<br/>
       I am always left baffled by the idea of taking on that responsibility,<br/>
       and even more so confused at how you and mother did it so well!
    <p>I am so lucky to be where I am in my life and it really is due to your<br/>
       fostering of my freedom, my drive to explore,<br/>
       and your assistance in allowing me to grow into the person I want to be.<br/>
       I really don't know who I would be without you.</p>

  </div>
  <p class="text_body">On a side note, I am really super excited to go snowboarding next season.<br/>
     I really want to go in the winter and have multiple potential rides.<br/>
     I just felt like sharing that.</p>
